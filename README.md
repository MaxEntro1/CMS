# UTD CMS 

To start, download XAMPP can follow its instructions. Then, once you download all the files, paste all the php files into the htdocs folder. Then download MYSQL Workbench or use MyPHPAdmin. For MySQL Workbench follow its instructions. Then once you have a host, use create.sql to make the schema and load.sql to load in the values. If you are using MySQL Workbench make sure to put the password you set as root in the PHP files. 

Open XAMPP and turn on Apache (and MySQL if not using MySQL Workbench) and go to the LandingPage.php 
If this works then you have installed it successfully.
